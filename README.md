## General Information
- We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- We are provided with data set and data descriptor to work on creating the model.

## Conclusions
- We can see that the equation of our best fitted line is:

demand_for_shared_bike = 0.2364 *  yr - 0.1008 * holiday + 0.5419 * temp - 0.1758 * windspeed + 0.0888 * Season_Summer + 0.1232 * Season_Winter + 0.0959 * Mnth_Sept - 0.047 * Weekday_Mon + 0.0975 * Weather_good

Overall we have a decent model, but we also acknowledge that we could do better.
